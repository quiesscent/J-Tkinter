![image]("./course_image.png")

This is a repo of the journey I am or will be undertaking in my journey to become a great python developer. 

It contains mini project of the topics learnt through in various platforms and resources gained elsewhere.

There will be an overall project with specific names, with which they will entail a combination of all the mini projects

Less of notes and discussions. Tk is a python standard library for building GUI applications alongside Pyqt and others.


# Happy Coding
